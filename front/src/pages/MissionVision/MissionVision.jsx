          <p>
            We envision a future where every temple stands **strong, safe, and
            sacred**, free from the threats of time and neglect. Our goal is to
            create a network of protected temples that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintain their **spiritual sanctity and cultural significance**.</li>
            <li>Are equipped with **modern safety measures** like fire prevention and security.</li>
            <li>Welcome devotees in a **clean, peaceful, and well-maintained** environment.</li>
            <li>Continue to serve as **centers of faith, learning, and tradition**.</li>
          </ul>
